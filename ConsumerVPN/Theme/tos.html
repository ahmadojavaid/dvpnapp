Our services

DorkVPN Services are transitory digital network communications services, which enhance internet security and privacy. At your individual request and at your sole discretion we automatically provide unsupervised and non-monitored data conduit – virtual private network (VPN) connection – for your exclusive use, at your own risk and responsibility. You are solely and exclusively responsible for the use of the DorkVPN Services. DorkVPN will not be liable in any way or form for actions done by its users including criminal liability and civil liability for harm executed or not executed. DorkVPN liability is further limited by other provisions of these Terms.

We grant you a permission to use the DorkVPN Services subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms. Your use of the DorkVPN Services is at your own risk. The DorkVPN Services may be modified, updated, interrupted or suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability for any harm or other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. DorkVPN, its owners, employees, agents and others that are involved with the DorkVPN services are not in any way or form liable for any harm of any kind executed or not executed, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any account registered with DorkVPN services.

DorkVPN allows a maximum of 10 simultaneous connections per account. That includes proxy connections, and each of them counts as a separate slot.

DorkVPN guarantees a 99.9% service uptime. In any event, DorkVPN shall not be liable for any loss, monetary or non-monetary harm beyond what the client paid to DorkVPN, and this shall not include attorney fees or court costs irrespective of any laws or statutes that prescribe otherwise.

DorkVPN collects and processes very limited user data. Further information about user data processing is provided in the Privacy Policy and User Data section of the Terms.

No-logs policy

DorkVPN guarantees a strict no-logs policy for DorkVPN Services, meaning that the DorkVPN Service is provided by an automated process, and your activities while using it are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored or passed to any third party. We do not store connection timestamps, session information, used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses or other data. However, to limit the number of simultaneous sessions of an active user, an algorithm keeps their username and the timestamp of the last session status while the session is active. This data is wiped within 15 minutes after the session is terminated.

DorkVPN does not condone or endorse any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities perpetrated by using the DorkVPN Services. Therefore, DorkVPN reserves the right to suspend or terminate an account in case any violation of the Terms of Service becomes apparent. As DorkVPN protects and respects customer privacy, it does not log or track their activity in any way. However, in the eventuality that DorkVPN would find out about an offense outside of those means (i.e., a customer would notify DorkVPN of them having done so), it would have the right to suspend or terminate the account.
